# Model-trained-for-drought-prediction
This project presents a multi-modal deep learning architecture for predicting hydrological droughts using satellite imagery, environmental time-series data, and contextual tabular features. The model leverages Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCNs) to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics across interconnected regions.
